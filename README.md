# DemoBookLibraries

This is a toy project created during my internship at Msensis.
Its purpose was to gradually introduce me to the basics of the Spring Framework.
The programming language that was used was Kotlin, of which I had no prior knowledge.

Please bear in mind that this was an educational project, 
so a lot of things got changed up, depricated code has been left around
and in general a lot of cleaning and refactoring needs to be done.

At the start, Rest Controllers were used,
but as the front end was implemented in Thymeleaf,
I switched to the @Controller Annotation.
